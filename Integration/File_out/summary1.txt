@2.0@ Cruise described his father as "a merchant of chaos", a "bully", and a "coward" who inflicted beatings upon him. @2.0@ Regarding his father, Cruise once said, " He was the kind of person where, if something goes wrong, they kick you. @2.8@ It was a great lesson in my lifeâ€”how he'd lull you in, make you feel safe and then, bang! For me, it was like, ' There's something wrong with this guy. @2.0@ Be careful around him.'" Cruise spent part of his childhood in Canada. @2.8@ His family moved to Beacon Hill, Ottawa in late 1971 so that Cruise's father could take a position as a defense consultant with the Canadian Armed Forces. @2.8@ There, Cruise attended the newly opened Robert Hopkins Public School for much of grade four and grade five. @2.8@ Cruise and six other boys put on an improvised play to music called IT at the Carleton Elementary School drama festival. @7.5@ After working as a busboy in New York, Cruise went to Los Angeles to try out for television roles. @7.5@ Cruise first appeared in a bit part in the 1981 film Endless Love, followed by a major supporting role as a crazed military academy student in Taps later that year.
