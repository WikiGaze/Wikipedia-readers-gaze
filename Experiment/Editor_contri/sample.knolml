					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county&#x27;s history.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt;

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]], on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county&#x27;s history.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt;

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

					==Impact==
					[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
					The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported.

					Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]], on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county&#x27;s history.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

					&quot;causing&quot; is a verb that must be paired with a noun, then linked with &quot;of&quot; to an object. &quot;Damaging&quot; is a nifty adverb that does the job of all three words.

					The &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;2006 Westchester County tornado&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]], on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county&#x27;s history.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

					The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

					==Meteorological synopsis==
					On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornadowatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJFunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;WCBS&quot;/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tornado1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name=&quot;THPWest&quot;/&gt;

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

					Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSSum&quot;/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place.
