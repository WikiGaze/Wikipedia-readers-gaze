@3.95@ These unimpressive study habits made sitting his finals a challenge, and he decided to answer only theoretical physics questions rather than those requiring factual knowledge. @3.95@ A first-class honours degree was a condition of acceptance for his planned graduate study in cosmology at the University of Cambridge. @7.9@ Anxious, he slept poorly the night before the examinations, and the final result was on the borderline between first- and second-class honours, making a viva (oral examination) with the Oxford examiners necessary. @3.95@ Hawking was concerned that he was viewed as a lazy and difficult student. @7.9@ So, when asked at the viva to describe his plans, he said, " If you award me a First, I will go to Cambridge. @11.85@ If I receive a Second, I shall stay in Oxford, so I expect you will give me a First." He was held in higher regard than he believed; as Berman commented, the examiners "were intelligent enough to realise they were talking to someone far cleverer than most of themselves". @9.4@ After receiving a first-class BA ( Hons.) degree in physics and completing a trip to Iran with a friend, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in October 1962. . @5.45@ Hawking's first year as a doctoral student was difficult.
