@4.45@ Despite his headmaster's advice to wait until the next year, Hawking was awarded a scholarship after taking the examinations in March 1959. . @4.45@ Hawking began his university education at University College, Oxford, in October 1959 at the age of 17. @4.45@ For the first 18 months, he was bored and lonely â€“ he found the academic work "ridiculously easy". @8.9@ His physics tutor, Robert Berman, later said, " It was only necessary for him to know that something could be done, and he could do it without looking to see how other people did it." A change occurred during his second and third year when, according to Berman, Hawking made more of an effort "to be one of the boys". @10.05@ He developed into a popular, lively and witty college member, interested in classical music and science fiction. @6.1@ Part of the transformation resulted from his decision to join the college boat club, the University College Boat Club, where he coxed a rowing crew. @6.1@ The rowing coach at the time noted that Hawking cultivated a daredevil image, steering his crew on risky courses that led to damaged boats. @6.1@ Hawking estimated that he studied about 1,000 hours during his three years at Oxford. @6.1@ These unimpressive study habits made sitting his finals a challenge, and he decided to answer only theoretical physics questions rather than those requiring factual knowledge.
