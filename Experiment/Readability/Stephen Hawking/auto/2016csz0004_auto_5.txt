@4.73@ He later blamed its "progressive methods" for his failure to learn to read while at the school. @4.73@ In St Albans, the eight-year-old Hawking attended St Albans High School for Girls for a few months. @2.73@ At that time, younger boys could attend one of the houses. @4.73@ Hawking attended two independent (i.e. fee-paying) schools, first Radlett School and from September 1952, St Albans School, after passing the eleven-plus a year early. @4.73@ Hawking's father wanted his son to attend the well-regarded Westminster School, but the 13-year-old Hawking was ill on the day of the scholarship examination. @2.73@ His family could not afford the school fees without the financial aid of a scholarship, so Hawking remained at St Albans.
