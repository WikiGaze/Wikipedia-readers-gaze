The Harry Potter series has been recognised by a host of awards since the initial publication of Philosophers Stone including four Whitaker Platinum Book Awards , three Nestle Smarties Book Prizes , two Scottish Arts Council Book Awards , the inaugural Whitbread childrens book of the year award , the WHSmith book of the year , among others.

In 1999, the winner of the Whitbread Book of the Year award childrens division was entered for the first time on the shortlist for the main award, and one judge threatened to resign if Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was declared the overall winner; it finished second, very close behind the winner of the poetry prize, Seamus Heaneys translation of the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf.In 2000, shortly before the publication of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the previous three Harry Potter books topped The New York Times fiction best-seller list and a third of the entries were childrens books.

In 2004, The New York Times further split the childrens list, which was still dominated by Harry Potter books into sections for series and individual books, and removed the Harry Potter books from the section for individual books.
